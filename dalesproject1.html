              <h1>Videogames</h1>
              <p>I'm sure that you have played videogames before, whether its on PC, XBOX, PS4, or Nintendo Switch(PC is the master race). 
              Here are some games that I highly reccomend for you or your hooligan friends to play, as well as some of my favorite games.</p>

                      <h3>League Of Legends</h3>
                      <p> In League of Legends, players assume the role of an unseen "summoner" that controls a "champion" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. 
                        The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team's "nexus", a structure which lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures,
                        although other distinct game modes exist as well. Each League of Legends match is discrete, with all champions starting off fairly weak but increasing in strength by accumulating items and experience over the course of the game. 
                        The champions and setting blend a variety of elements, including high fantasy, steampunk, and Lovecraftian horror.
                        League of Legends was generally well received upon its release in 2009,
                        and has since grown in popularity, with an active and expansive fanbase. By July 2012, League of Legends was the most played PC game in North America and Europe in terms of the number of hours played. </p>

                      <h3>Counter Strike Global Offensive(CSGO)</h3>
                      <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve Corporation. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series and was 
                      released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, with the Linux version released in September 2014. The game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists. 
                      Both sides are tasked with eliminating the other while also completing separate objectives, the Terrorists, depending on the game mode, must either plant the bomb or defend the hostages,
                      while the Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb, or rescue the hostages. There are eight game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode.</p>

                      <h3>Brawlhalla</h3>
                      <p>In all of Brawlhalla's gamemodes, the goal is to knock one's opponent off the stage, comparable to Super Smash Bros. This can be done by applying damage on them repeatedly. Damage can be seen on the color display 
                      around the opponent's character icon, which goes from white to red as the player continues to get hit. The closer the color is to red, the further the player will be knocked back, until they eventually get knocked out.
                      Getting knocked off the stage will result in the player losing a stock or life. Either the last player standing (the one who still has at least one stock) or the player with the most points wins the match.</p>
