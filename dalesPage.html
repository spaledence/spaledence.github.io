              <h1>THE JUICIEST DOGS IN THE WORLD</h1>
              <p>Sausage is one of the oldest forms of processed food, having been mentioned in Homer's Odyssey as far back as the 9th Century B.C.
Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, is traditionally credited with originating the frankfurter. However, this claim is disputed by those who 
assert that the popular sausage -known as a "dachshund" or "little-dog" sausage - was created in the late 1600's by Johann Georghehner, 
a butcher, living in Coburg, Germany. According to this report, Georghehner later traveled to Frankfurt to promote his new product.</p>
