              <h1>About me</h1>
              <p> Wassup boys and girls, children of all ages. I am Dale the Dungeon Master Spence. I am currently a sophomore attending Granada High School. Some of my hobbies include: gaming, basketball, fishing, and watching movies.
              I was born in San Ramon, but have lived in Livermore my whole life. I am half Japanese, so I can speak the language fluently and often take trips to Japan. Feel free to browse around my spectacular website 
              as much as you would like.  </p>
